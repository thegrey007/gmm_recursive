# GMM Recursive Training

This repository contains code for model collapse in GMMs during recursive training and bounds using the Add-Delta estimator.

- bounding_lessthan contains code for the upper bound on the add delta estimator
- MNIST_18by18 contains code for the MNIST model collapse experiment on GMMs
- unequal_gmm_new contains code for model collapse on a variety of GMMs
- image_dataset_exp_dogcat contains code for the model collapse experiment on a real life dog-cat dataset. This dataset can be found in dogcat_small.zip. Please change the root path according to the path of the extracted dataset.
